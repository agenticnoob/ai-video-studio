# Final Product Goal

Status: authoritative product target and roadmap source.

This document defines the long-term generation target for `ai-video-studio`.
When roadmap, architecture, provider, template, TTS, or media-layer work needs
direction, use this document as the highest-level product goal. More specific
documents such as `PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md`, `PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE.md`,
`TEMPLATE_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `MEDIA_LAYERS.md`, and provider notes should align
with this target.

## 0. Product Statement

最终目标：

用户输入提示词后，系统把用户提示词、系统提示词、当前项目已注册的模版、
每个模版的能力和使用场景交给 LLM。LLM 先分析这个视频应该有几个分镜，
并为每个分镜返回：

- 当前分镜的大概内容
- 当前分镜选择的一个主模版
- 当前分镜的台词 / narration
- 当前分镜大概展示什么画面

然后系统按分镜循环生成：

1. 用当前分镜台词调用 TTS，生成当前分镜语音。
2. 读取或归一化当前语音的真实时长。
3. 把真实时长、当前分镜选择的模版信息、当前分镜大致内容、台词、
   全局风格上下文交给 LLM。
4. LLM 只返回该模版需要的 schema-valid 参数。
5. 系统把 `templateId`、生成语音、真实时长、模版参数组合成当前分镜。
6. 全部分镜生成后，系统把它们组装成一个完整 `VideoProject`，用于预览、
   编辑、重新生成和本地导出。

The English sections below turn this product statement into engineering
contracts, roadmap order, and scope boundaries.

## 1. Final Goal

`ai-video-studio` should turn a user's loose creative prompt into a complete,
watchable, audible, editable, and locally exportable video.

The final generation model is not a single LLM call that directly emits a full
`VideoProject`. The final model is an orchestrated pipeline:

```txt
user prompt
  -> storyboard planning
  -> per-segment narration / TTS
  -> per-segment template compilation
  -> assembled VideoProject
  -> preview, edit, regenerate, export
```

The system should:

1. Understand the user's creative intent.
2. Choose how many segments / shots the video needs.
3. Select one primary registered template for each segment.
4. Write or refine narration for each segment.
5. Generate TTS audio for each segment before final template parameters are
   compiled.
6. Use the real audio duration to generate schema-valid template parameters.
7. Assemble all compiled segments into one `VideoProject`.
8. Let the user preview, edit, regenerate, and export the full video.

This keeps the product segment-first, template-driven, voice-aware, and
scalable as the template library grows.

## 2. Authoritative Terminology

Use these terms consistently.

| Product idea | Current / target model | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User prompt | `brief` / creative intent | The user's initial topic, story, requirement, or instruction. |
| Shot / storyboard segment / 分镜 | `VideoSegment` | The user-facing editable unit in the final video. |
| Template | `templateId` + template module | A registered implementation mechanism for one segment. |
| Template choice | `templateId` | The primary template selected for a segment. |
| Narration / 台词 | `narration.text` target model | The spoken script for one segment. |
| TTS result | narration audio asset metadata | Generated audio file plus duration, provider, voice, and related metadata. |
| Template parameters | `implementation` | The template-specific data needed by the selected renderer. |
| Compiled segment | `VideoSegment` | Template choice + narration/audio metadata + validated implementation. |
| Full video | `VideoProject` | The assembled project used by preview, editing, and export. |

Important modeling rules:

- A `VideoSegment` has one primary `templateId`.
- `templateId` determines the schema of `implementation`.
- `implementation` is template-specific, not a universal project field.
- Narration text and generated audio should become segment-level generation
  data over time, not be hidden only inside one template's private fields.
- Existing `scripted` support for `VideoSpec.scenes[].voiceover` is a useful
  compatibility entry point, but the long-term target should distinguish
  spoken text from generated audio source.
- `VideoSpec.scenes` is specific to the `scripted` template.
- Future templates should define their own implementation fields.
- Do not model one segment as multiple template instances unless a concrete
  future workflow proves that template-internal composition is insufficient.

## 3. Target Generation Pipeline

### 3.1 Stage A: Storyboard Planning

The first LLM call is a planner call. It should not receive every template's
complete schema, and it should not generate final render parameters.

Planner input:

- user prompt
- system planning prompt
- project-level constraints such as tone, aspect ratio, target length, language,
  audience, and style hints when available
- registered template manifest, not full renderer code
- template descriptions, use cases, capabilities, constraints, and recommended
  duration ranges

Planner output:

```ts
type StoryboardPlan = {
  title: string;
  brief: string;
  language?: string;
  globalStyle?: string;
  segments: StoryboardSegmentPlan[];
};

type StoryboardSegmentPlan = {
  id: string;
  order: number;
  title?: string;
  purpose: string;
  templateId: TemplateId;
  templateReason: string;
  narration: {
    text: string;
    tone?: string;
  };
  visualBrief: string;
  pacingHint?: string;
  expectedDurationSeconds?: number;
};
```

Planner responsibilities:

- decide how many segments the video needs
- decide each segment's communication purpose
- choose the best `templateId` from the template manifest
- write a narration draft for each segment
- describe the visual content each segment should roughly show
- preserve global continuity across all segments

Planner non-responsibilities:

- do not generate final `implementation`
- do not invent template ids
- do not write Remotion source code
- do not receive runtime renderer internals
- do not create arbitrary media URLs

Why this stage exists:

- It keeps template selection separate from low-level parameter filling.
- It avoids sending every template's full schema as the template library grows.
- It creates a stable intermediate artifact that can be edited, audited, and
  partially regenerated.

### 3.2 Stage B: Segment Narration And TTS

For each planned segment, the system generates voice audio before compiling the
template implementation.

TTS input:

- segment narration text
- language
- desired voice / voice profile when selected
- tone or delivery hint
- segment id and project id for deterministic artifact naming

TTS output:

```ts
type SegmentNarrationAsset = {
  text: string;
  audioSrc: string;
  durationInFrames: number;
  durationInSeconds: number;
  voiceId?: string;
  provider?: string;
  format?: "mp3" | "wav" | "aac" | "m4a";
};
```

TTS responsibilities:

- produce a local or serveable audio asset
- report the real duration
- keep enough metadata to support regeneration and debugging
- make preview and export use the same audio asset

TTS non-responsibilities:

- do not decide the final visual implementation
- do not mutate unrelated segments
- do not become a full audio workstation
- do not require waveform editing, ducking, beat sync, or timeline UI for the
  first implementation

Why TTS happens before template compilation:

- Real spoken duration controls segment duration.
- Visual pacing should fit the voiceover, not the other way around.
- Template parameter generation can use the real number of frames.
- Later caption and subtitle timing can be derived from the same narration
  artifact.

Duration guard:

- Each template should expose recommended duration constraints.
- If generated narration is too long or too short for the selected template,
  the system should choose a bounded repair path:
  - shorten or expand narration
  - split the segment
  - choose a better template
  - ask the user only if automatic repair would change intent too much

### 3.3 Stage C: Segment Template Compilation

After TTS, the system compiles each segment into template-specific render data.

Compiler input:

- one `StoryboardSegmentPlan`
- its `SegmentNarrationAsset`
- real `durationInFrames`
- selected template's complete schema
- selected template's implementation rules
- selected template examples, if needed
- limited global project context

Compiler output:

```ts
type CompiledVideoSegment = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  templateId: TemplateId;
  narration?: SegmentNarrationAsset;
  visualBrief?: string;
  implementation: TemplateImplementation;
  durationInFrames: number;
};
```

Compiler responsibilities:

- fill only the selected template's schema
- use the real TTS duration as the timing anchor
- keep visual content aligned with `visualBrief` and narration
- produce data that passes Zod validation
- preserve the selected template unless repair requires a template change

Compiler non-responsibilities:

- do not re-plan the whole video by default
- do not choose among all templates again unless duration or validation repair
  requires it
- do not write Remotion source code
- do not invent fields outside the selected template schema

Validation and repair:

- Every compiled segment must pass the selected template's Zod schema.
- Repair prompts should be bounded and template-specific.
- Repair should include validation errors, selected template schema, narration
  duration, and the previous invalid output.
- After a small number of failed repairs, the system should return a clear
  error instead of silently falling back to unrelated content.

### 3.4 Stage D: Project Assembly

The system assembles compiled segments into a `VideoProject`.

Assembly responsibilities:

- preserve the original brief
- preserve ordered compiled segments
- compute or normalize durations
- ensure preview and export consume the same project payload
- keep generated assets reachable by Remotion

The assembled `VideoProject` remains the top-level boundary for:

- page state
- preview input props
- selected-segment editing
- segment regeneration
- render/export request body
- downloaded render artifacts

## 4. Context Strategy For Many Templates

The final architecture should use two levels of template context.

### 4.1 Planner Template Manifest

The planner receives a compact manifest for all registered templates.

Manifest fields should include:

- `templateId`
- label
- short description
- best use cases
- avoid cases
- text density
- recommended duration range
- narration fit
- media or asset expectations
- examples of segment intents the template handles well

The planner should use this manifest to choose templates. It should not need
complete JSON schemas for every template.

### 4.2 Template Compiler Context

The compiler receives the full context for only the selected template.

Compiler context may include:

- complete JSON schema / Zod-derived schema
- implementation prompt
- renderer constraints
- duration rules
- field-level guidance
- examples
- repair instructions

Runtime adapters and React/Remotion renderer code stay internal. The LLM only
sees the template contract, not the implementation source code.

Why this matters:

- Template count can grow without exploding planner context.
- Each compiler call stays focused and easier to validate.
- Template-local ownership remains clean.
- New templates can be added by registering metadata, schema, compiler context,
  editor fields, and runtime adapter.

## 5. Editing And Regeneration Model

The final product should support regeneration at the smallest useful scope.

Recommended edit scopes:

- full project re-plan: user changes the whole brief or story direction
- segment re-plan: user changes what one segment should say or do
- narration regenerate: user changes the spoken script or voice
- TTS regenerate: user keeps narration text but changes voice/delivery
- implementation regenerate: user keeps narration/audio but changes visuals
- field edit: user directly edits template parameters

Regeneration rules:

- If narration text changes, rerun TTS and segment compilation.
- If only the voice changes, rerun TTS and segment compilation only when timing
  changes enough to affect visuals.
- If only visual direction changes, reuse existing narration audio and rerun
  template compilation.
- If template changes, rerun template compilation and validate against the new
  template schema.
- Non-target segments should be preserved unless the user asks for broader
  re-planning.

This keeps editing fast while respecting the dependencies between narration,
audio duration, and visual timing.

## 6. Relationship To Current Implementation

The current implementation is a useful v1 shortcut:

```txt
brief
  -> MiniMax project generation
  -> schema-valid VideoProject
  -> preview/edit/export
```

This path can stay while it is sufficient. The final target evolves it into:

```txt
brief
  -> StoryboardPlan
  -> per-segment TTS
  -> per-segment template compiler
  -> assembled VideoProject
  -> preview/edit/export
```

Do not treat the current one-call `POST /api/generate` path as the permanent
generation architecture. Treat it as the shipped v1 authoring loop that proves
preview, editing, template rendering, validation, and export.

Current compatibility notes:

- `VideoProject` remains the top-level contract.
- `VideoSegment` remains the editing unit.
- `scripted` currently has `VideoSpec.scenes[].voiceover`.
- `ScriptedVideo` already renders scene voiceover with Remotion `<Audio>`.
- This is enough to build the first TTS slice without designing the whole media
  layer system first.
- Long-term narration metadata should be separated from audio src so the system
  can distinguish spoken text, generated audio, voice, timing, and provider.

## 7. Roadmap

Roadmap work should follow this target unless a later product decision updates
this document.

### Milestone 0: Shipped V1 Authoring Loop

Status: implemented.

Implemented capability:

- prompt input
- MiniMax-backed `POST /api/generate`
- schema-validated `VideoProject`
- registered `scripted` and `spotlight` templates
- full-video preview
- selected-segment editing
- selected-segment regeneration
- local Remotion export

Known limitation:

- generation is still largely one provider call that emits the final
  `VideoProject`
- TTS asset generation exists as an internal staged-pipeline slice, but it is
  not part of the main generation path yet
- real audio duration does not yet drive template compilation

### Milestone 1: Authoritative Goal And Contracts

Status: implemented.

Deliverables:

- this document
- updated PRD / README / agent notes that point to this target
- explicit statement that the final path is planner -> TTS -> compiler ->
  assembly
- explicit statement that current one-shot generation is a v1 shortcut

### Milestone 2: Storyboard Plan Contract

Status: groundwork implemented; route integration and planner repair remain
future slices.

Goal:

- introduce a planner output contract before changing the full runtime path

Implemented:

- `StoryboardPlan` schema
- `StoryboardSegmentPlan` schema
- planner template manifest derived from registered templates
- planner prompt that receives compact template metadata
- internal MiniMax function that can produce and validate a plan

Remaining:

- route or main generation wrapper that uses the planner result
- basic repair path for invalid planner output

Non-goals:

- no TTS requirement yet
- no media layers
- no new template orchestration model

### Milestone 3: TTS Asset MVP

Status: first internal asset/API boundary implemented; active product-route
integration remains a future slice.

Goal:

- generate audio from planned segment narration and measure real duration

Implemented:

- `SegmentNarrationAsset` validation
- MiniMax-backed internal `POST /api/tts` for one planned segment
- local artifact writing under `out/tts/...`
- `/api/tts/assets/...` serving for Remotion-consumable audio URLs
- ffprobe duration measurement and frame normalization

Deliverables:

- TTS provider module
- local audio artifact path such as `out/tts/...`
- audio serving path that Remotion can consume
- duration probing or provider-returned duration normalization
- `SegmentNarrationAsset` metadata
- first UI or API action that generates voiceover for a selected scripted
  segment

Remaining:

- wire TTS into the main planner -> compiler flow
- feed generated narration audio into the selected template compiler
- make preview/export use generated audio through compiled template output

Initial scope:

- one voice or simple voice selection
- one provider
- `scripted` template first
- no waveform editor
- no background music
- no global media timeline

### Milestone 4: Audio-Duration-Driven Segment Compiler

Goal:

- use real TTS duration to compile one segment's template parameters

Deliverables:

- selected-template compiler prompt
- selected-template schema-only context
- compile function that accepts plan + narration asset + duration
- strict Zod validation
- bounded repair
- `scripted` segment support first
- preview/export uses generated audio

Success criteria:

- a generated segment plays with TTS audio
- segment duration matches or safely contains the audio duration
- template visual timing is generated from audio duration, not arbitrary
  guessed timing

### Milestone 5: Full Pipeline Integration

Goal:

- replace or wrap one-shot project generation with the target staged pipeline

Deliverables:

- full generate action runs planner -> TTS loop -> compiler loop -> assembly
- page can display generation progress by stage
- segment regeneration chooses the smallest needed stage
- generated project remains editable and exportable through existing paths
- non-target segments are preserved during segment-level edits

### Milestone 6: Multi-Template Scaling

Goal:

- make the staged pipeline scale as templates increase

Deliverables:

- richer planner manifest per template
- template-specific compiler contexts
- examples and constraints per template
- duration guard per template
- template-specific repair prompts
- tests or smoke fixtures for each registered template

### Milestone 7: Narration, Captions, And Audio Polish

Goal:

- improve the audible video experience after the basic TTS loop works

Deliverables:

- caption/subtitle data derived from narration
- per-segment voice selection
- optional project-level narration consistency
- volume normalization
- optional background music support
- simple audio mix rules

### Milestone 8: Media Layers And Existing Assets

Goal:

- add external image/video/audio/color material after generated narration is
  stable

Deliverables:

- project-level `media.layers[]`
- shared Remotion media renderer
- compact structured media editor
- later segment-level media if a concrete workflow requires it

Important ordering:

- media layers are important, but they should not block the TTS-first
  generation pipeline
- generated narration audio can later be migrated or represented through media
  layers if that becomes the cleanest cross-template model

### Milestone 9: Persistence And Generation History

Goal:

- preserve intermediate artifacts so the user can iterate without losing
  context

Deliverables:

- saved `StoryboardPlan`
- saved TTS metadata
- saved compiler prompts/results
- validation/repair history
- project draft persistence
- render history

## 8. Non-Goals Until Explicitly Reopened

Do not use this roadmap to accidentally expand scope into:

- multi-template-per-segment orchestration
- full professional timeline editing
- AI-generated Remotion source code as the default path
- uploaded media management before TTS generation works
- generated images/videos before narration audio works
- waveform editing, ducking, beat sync, or DAW-style audio controls in the TTS
  MVP
- broad provider abstraction before one concrete provider path proves the
  staged pipeline

## 9. Decision Rules

When choosing between possible next steps, prefer work that moves the product
toward:

1. a better `StoryboardPlan`
2. generated narration audio
3. real audio duration driving template parameters
4. one selected template's schema-valid implementation
5. reliable assembly into `VideoProject`
6. preview/export parity
7. segment-level regeneration with minimal blast radius

Prefer deferring work that mainly improves:

- generic media editing
- broad timeline editing
- persistence/history
- template marketplace behavior
- generated source-code workflows

Those may become important later, but they are not the main bridge from prompt
to complete generated video.
